Week One
--------

>*During week one we looked at Point. We practiced in 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 points before moving onto screen where we were tasked with creating our own Iphone backgroundsts using only point.*


Type Specimen Poster Project
----------
>>##[Type Poster] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/aynsleylongridge/albums/72157658168126174 "Type Poster").
>The first project for this module was to create an A3 Type Specimen Poster based a list of fonts. For this project I choose the font Baskerville. During this project trying to create what I had visioned proved difficult...resulting in four different posters. But, I think I got there in the end, thankfully!
